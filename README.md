udon: a distributed static file web server
=============================

Udon is a static file web service, generally intended to be used at the edge of a network to serve static assets for websites like CSS files, javascript, images or other content which does not change frequently or is dynamically part of the web application state.

It's also built on top of [riak_core][0] and provides a simple application which is intended to introduce the kinds of programming that's required to implement a riak_core application including handoff logic between vnodes.  I wrote this as a tool to teach for [Erlang Factory SF 2015][1].
